# JS-Challenges

Here You will find a list of some of my favorite challenges that I have completed and had fun with while doing. 

A mix of Easy, Medium, and Hard challenges.

Each folder is named after the site where the challenge is held and inside contains a .js file with the name of that specific challenge.

If you input the code directly onto the site. Please make sure to watch out for return vs console.log output swap.

I recommend giving these a try and see if  you can come up with more creative answers!
