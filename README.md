# JS-Challenges

Here You will find a list of some of my favorite challenges that I have completed and had fun with while doing. 

Each folder contains a .js file with instructions at the top and my solution to this at the bottom.

To just grab these and run in the browswer, make sure you check if I am using console.log() instead of return or vice-versa.
